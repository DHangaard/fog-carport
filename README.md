# Carport Web Application

This repository contains a web application developed as part of an exam project in the danish Datamatiker education.

The project is based on a case provided by Fog and addresses the challenge of supporting the sales process for custom-built carports. 

The system is designed to reflect real-world business constraints, where customers can request a carport offer, sellers prepare and validate the offer, and material lists are only disclosed after payment.

The application has been developed with a strong focus on business logic, data integrity, and clear separation of responsibilities, rather than visual polish or full commercial completeness.

## Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to analyze a real-world problem and translate business requirements into a structured software solution. 
Requirements were derived from an interview-based analysis and subsequently refined into user stories and technical implementations.

The system supports:
- Customer inquiries and offer presentation
- Controlled order flow from request to paid order
- Automated calculation of prices and material lists
- Seller validation and adjustment of offers
- Clear separation of customer and seller access to data

The solution is implemented as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and prioritizes correctness, maintainability, and traceability from requirements to code.

## Project Context

- Exam project for the Datamatiker program
- Developed using a layered, MVC-inspired architecture
- Focus on requirements analysis, domain modeling, and business logic
- Customer requirements derived from video interview material
